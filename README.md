# Tab Closer for Zoom

A small WebExtension that auto closes the zoom tab (https://zoom.us/) when you launch a meeting, because it doesn't do that itself for some reason.

Find it published for Firefox here (manifest v2, working perfectly fine as version 0.3.5):

And Chrome here (regrettably, manifest v3, available as version 0.3.5.1):
